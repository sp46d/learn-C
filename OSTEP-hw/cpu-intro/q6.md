# Question 6

One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (`./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -c -p -I IO_RUN_LATER`) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

## My answer

Four processes are initialized, where one process issuses three I/O requests, each takes 5 time units to be done, and all the other three processes do 5 CPU-bound instructions. Since each I/O request takes 5 time units to be done and it switches to another process while it's waiting for an I/O to be done, all the CPU works can be effectively done during its waiting time. Thus, yes, system resources are effectively utilized for this work. Below is the result:

```

## Why my answer is wrong

From the result shown above, I figured that with `IO_RUN_LATER`, the system keeps running all the CPU-bound processes and never comes back to the first process before all those CPU-bound processes complete, even though the first I/O completes in the middle. This is where my answer gets it wrong. I thought when a CPU-bound process gets done, which is exactly when the first I/O is done, the system would come back and pick up the first process that issused an I/O request, but it didn't. In this case, the system resource was not effectively utilized, because CPU wasn't kept busy during the second and third I/Os.
