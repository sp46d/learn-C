# Question 3

Switch the order of the processes: `-l 1:0,4:100`. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use `-c` and `-p` to see if you were right)

# My answer

Switching the order of the processes matters here, because now the process that issues an I/O request runs first, so the second process that uses cpu can run while the first process wait for the I/O request to be done. Thus, the total time for both processes to be done will be 7 time units, the same length as it takes the I/O process to be done. Below is the result of running the programm with the `-c` and `-p` flags:

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1
  2        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  4        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  5        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  6        BLOCKED          DONE                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1

Stats: Total Time 7
Stats: CPU Busy 6 (85.71%)
Stats: IO Busy  5 (71.43%)
