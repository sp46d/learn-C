# Question 8

Now run with some randomly generated processes using flags `-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 3 -l 3:50,3:50`. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` versus that flag `-I IO_RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use the flag `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` versus `-S SWITCH_ON_END`?

## My answer

With randomly generated processes using `-l 3:50,3:50`, there are 50% chances for each instruction to be either an I/O- or CPU-bound instruction. So, the total time for a process to be done is largely depending on how many instructions are I/O-bounded or CPU-bounded. With the flag `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` set, when an instruction issues an I/O request, the other process can use CPU during the time the I/O request is being handled, which makes an effective use of CPU. The flag `-I` can specify how to behave when an I/O is done, although, in this case, this flag makes little differences, because CPU-bound instructions are not very heavy (at most 3 time units). The major difference comes from the flage `-S`, which specifies process switching behaviors. When we use `-S SWITCH_ON_END`, the second process waits until the entire instructions of the first process gets completed even if it has lots of instructions that do I/O requests. In that case, CPU will not get utilized most of the time, resulting in an ineffective use of system resources.
