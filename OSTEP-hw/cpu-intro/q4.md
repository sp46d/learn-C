# Question 4

Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to `SWITCH_ON_END`, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

## My answer

If it does not switch to another process while one process is doing I/O, the second process that does CPU work only can run after the first process gets done. Thus, it takes the same length of time as it does for `-l 4:100,1:0` that we saw in the previous question, which is 11 time units. Below is the result of `-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`:

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END -p
