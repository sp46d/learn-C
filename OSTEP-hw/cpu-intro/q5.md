# Question 5

Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O(`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`). What happens now? Use `-c` and `-p` to confirm that you are right.

## My answer

It will be the same as (Question 3)[./q3.md], where it switches to another process while one process is wating for an I/O to be done. It takes 7 time units to complete both processes as the CPU process can get done while the other process is waiting for its I/O request to be done. Below is the result:

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO -p

  7*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1
