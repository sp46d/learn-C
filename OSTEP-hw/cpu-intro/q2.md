# Question 2

Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use `-c` and `-p` to find out if you were right.

## My answer

Two processes will get initialized, where one uses cpu 100% and one issues an I/O request. Without specifying the I/O length (i.e., how long it takes to get I/O done) using the `-L` flag, the default is 5 time units, so the second process must wait 5 time units until the I/O request is done. With this in mind, the total time unit to complete both processes will be: 4 time units for the first process and 7 time units for the second process, which includes 1 time unit for issuing an I/O request and another 1 time unit for handling the completed I/O request, total 11 time units. Result of running the program with `-c` and `-p` is as follows:

```
$  ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0 -c -p
