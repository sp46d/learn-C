# Question 7

Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

## My answer

With `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE`, I think the system would immediately runs the process that issued the I/O when it's completed. This differs from the previous program in that it now completes all the CPU-bound processes during the time it's waiting for an I/O to be done.

To answer the second question: it might be a good idea to run a process that just completed an I/O again because the process may issue another I/O request. If it does, we can utilize its waiting time to handle other CPU-bound processes, keeping CPU busy, and hence system resource can effectively be utilized, while running the program.

```
