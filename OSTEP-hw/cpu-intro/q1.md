# Question 1

1. Run `process-run.py` with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100`. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the `-c` and `-p` flags to see if you were right.

## My answer

Two processes will get initialized and both will use cpu 100% during their execution time. The two processes will get executed sequentially, that is, one will get its turn only after another one is done. This is because we specify using the `-l` flag that each of the two processes consists of five instructions, where each instruction uses cpu with 100% chances. Below are the results of running the program with `-c` and `-p` flags.

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p

 10           DONE       RUN:cpu             1
