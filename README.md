# Learning C prgoramming language

This repository is for recording my journey in learning C programming language. As a complete beginner in C (although I have a little experience in programming with R and Python), there are various ways to start learning the language out there, but I've chosen the following path:

- CS50 for high-level understanding of the language,
- The C Programming Language, 2nd edition, by Kernighan and Ritchie for the language's minimalist syntax and idioms,
- C Programming: A Modern Approach by King for modern practices (C99) and more advanced topics.

As I was learning C, I've come to realize that the best way to learn a programming language is to learn by doing it. All those three sources mentioned above include a set of exercises to check my understanding of the topic, so I decided to commit myself to solving the exercises as I go. I share my own way of tackling the exercises through this repository, so I hope it helps anyone on the same journey of learning C as I am.
